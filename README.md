Readable
Project at the end of Udacity's React/Redux course.

This project allows for users to view, add, edit and delete posts that are categorized under three different categories.

You can get this project started by cloning the repo, and starting both the server and the frontend:
- cd into the frontend folder, run npm install and npm start.
- go back and cd into the api-server and run node server

Thanks! Shelby
